                <p>
                    As a dedicated computer science student, I specialize in Java and C, with a keen interest in solving real-world problems through technology. 
                    My internship in full-stack development allowed me to contribute to a project called <strong>Insurance Management System</strong>, where I honed my skills in software development and system integration.
                    Outside of my studies, I am passionate about drawing, which enhances my creativity, attention to detail, and ability to think outside the box.

                    I am a fourth-year computer science student at Birzeit University, with a strong interest in technology, innovation, and AI/machine learning. 
                    I am skilled in several programming languages, including Java and C.I thrive in team settings and value creativity and leadership,
                    which have contributed to the success of group projects like developing an <strong>Android app for renting cars</strong> as part of the COMP4310 course. 
                    Outside of academics, I am committed to volunteer work.

        <h2 class="concept-title">HTTP: An Overview</h2> 
        <div class="concept-box">
            <img src="imgs/http1.jpg" alt="HTTP Overview" class="concept-image">
            <h3 class="highlight-title">What is HTTP?</h3>
            <h4>
                HTTP: hypertext transfer protocol
            </h4>

            <p>
                HTTP is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes, such as machine-to-machine communication, programmatic access to APIs, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                HTTP follows a classical client-server model, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response from the server. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any session data between two requests, although the later addition of cookies adds state to some client-server interactions.
            </p>
            
            <h3>HTTP request methods:</h3>
            <p>
                HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the purpose of the request and what is expected if the request is successful. Although they can also be nouns, these request methods are sometimes referred to as HTTP verbs. Each request method has its own semantics, but some characteristics are shared across multiple methods, specifically request methods can be safe, idempotent, or cacheable.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>GET : </strong>
                    The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should not contain a request content.</li>
                <li><strong>HEAD : </strong>
                    The HEAD method asks for a response identical to a GET request, but without a response body.</li>
                <li><strong>POST : </strong>
                    The POST method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.</li>
                <li><strong>PUT : </strong>
                    The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request content.</li>
               
            </ul>

            <h3>HTTP response status codes:</h3>
            <p>
                HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. Responses are grouped in five classes:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Informational responses (100 – 199).</li>
                <li>Successful responses (200 – 299).</li>
                <li>Redirection messages (300 – 399).</li>
                <li>Client error responses (400 – 499).</li>
                <li>Server error responses (500 – 599).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Using HTTP cookies:</h3>
           

            <p>
                A cookie (also known as a web cookie or browser cookie) is a small piece of data a server sends to a user's web browser. The browser may store cookies, create new cookies, modify existing ones, and send them back to the same server with later requests. Cookies enable web applications to store limited amounts of data and remember state information; by default the HTTP protocol is stateless.
            </p>
            <h4>What cookies are used for</h4>
           
            <img src="imgs/cookies.jpg" alt="Cookies" class="center-image">

            <h4>Cookies are mainly used for three purposes:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>management:</strong> User sign-in status, shopping cart contents, game scores, or any other user session-related details that the server needs to remember.</li>
                <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> User preferences such as display language and UI theme.</li>
                <li><strong>Tracking:</strong> Recording and analyzing user behavior.</li>
                
            </ul>
